<p>I made this webpage to talk about my two great pups. I have two dogs, Copper and Tiny. Tiny is a six year old Shih Tzu Chihuahua mix. Copper is an eleven year old Golden Retriever. Copper and Tiny both live at my parents' house. I miss them a lot while I am at school. They are so sweet and obviously photogenic! Copper was a gift to me and my sisters from my parents for Christmas one year. We received him and his sister, Ginger. She passed away a few years ago. They were tiny little pups with red bows on them. The joy of receiving them was so much fun! Tiny was a stray dog that my aunt found and my family and I loved him so much immediately she gave him to us. I'm so glad to have them both now!</p>

<p> I shared my story of the joy the dogs brought to my life in hopes to save others. There are plenty of dogs in need of a good home and you could be that home for them! There are many places here in Athens to adopt, the humane society, Petsmart, animal control, etc. So please look into it today! </P>
